Vim truly the best editor ever.

## Getting Started

Don't worry I'll not try to convince you that Vim is the best editor of history.
If you're comfortable with your current text editor stay with it and close your
browser. But If you really want to be productive on editing and writing beautiful
code in less time you should test and see Vim powers by yourself. This is my Vim
distribution that you can use to start with it quickly.

### Installation

    $ curl https://github.com/rainerborene/vimfiles/raw/master/install.sh | bash

### Learning

Vim is one of the open source projects that has the best documentation I have 
ever seen. I started with Vim by watching Vimcasts videos and reading the 
official documentation (I still do it). Just don't limit with these ways.

- [Vimcasts](http://vimcasts.org)
- [Thought Bot Blog](http://robots.thoughtbot.com)
- [Akita On Rails](http://akitaonrails.com)
- [Official Documentation](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/usr_toc.html)

### Resources

- [Bitstream Vera Sans Mono](http://www.dafont.com/bitstream-vera-mono.font)

### Credits

Thank to tpope for his amazing work on fugitive and other plugins. Drew Nils 
for running Vimcasts, and everyone else who contributed to Vim. I won't lie 
to you, my vimrc was entirely [based](https://github.com/tpope/tpope) on [other](https://github.com/nelstrom/dotfiles) 
people's [vimrc](https://github.com/akitaonrails/vimfiles).
