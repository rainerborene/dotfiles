## Getting Started

### Vim

Don't worry I'll not try to convince you that Vim is the best editor of history.
If you're comfortable with your current text editor stay with it and close your
browser. But If you really want to be productive on editing and writing beautiful
code in less time you should test and see Vim powers by yourself. This is my Vim
distribution that you can use to start with it quickly.

#### Installation

    $ curl https://github.com/rainerborene/dotfiles/raw/master/install.sh | bash

#### Learning

Vim is one of the open source projects that has the best documentation I have 
ever seen. If you prefer you can start watching Vimcasts videos or reading 
the official documentation, blogs and others. Some cool stuff below:

- [Vimcasts](http://vimcasts.org)
- [Thought Bot Blog](http://robots.thoughtbot.com)
- [Akita On Rails](http://akitaonrails.com)
- [Official Documentation](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/usr_toc.html)

### Credits

I won't lie to you, my vimrc was entirely [based](https://github.com/tpope/tpope) 
on [other](https://github.com/nelstrom/dotfiles) people's [vimrc](https://github.com/akitaonrails/vimfiles).
